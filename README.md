## Setup
To run this project, you'll need Node.js (which comes with npm) installed on your computer.

## Attention
Unfortunately weather sensors aboard NASA's InSight Mars lander stopped providing data on Sunday, Aug. 16, 2020, a result of an issue affecting the sensor suite's electronics so my app doesn't work :/
